# WGAN_SAGAN_pepegen
A GAN network to generate images of pepe. Or images in generell.

This GAN is based on the SAGAN and the WGAN. So it is a Wasserstein GAN but with a self attention layer based on the SAGAN.
Everything is implemented in Tensorflow 2 using jupyter notebooks. Logging on Tensorboard is also implemented.

Best result so far (still not great but more training might help):
